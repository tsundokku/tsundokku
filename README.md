👋 Hi, I’m @tsundokku. I'm a college student pursuing a degree in radiologic technology.

I haven't coded in many years, but I plan to get back into it in the near future! I have a small amount of experience with HTML, CSS, Batch, and Python. I am currently a Windows user, but I have a bit of experience with Linux as well. I also have dabbled with both Android and iOS. The only major platform I have very limited experience with is macOS.

I'm interested in learning more about coding, particularly for automations, bots for chat platforms, and mobile app development! I also think game modding is pretty cool and I hope to get into that as well!

I'm always down to make more friends, so feel free to follow me and reach out to me!
